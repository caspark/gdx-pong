A Pong Game Using [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)
============================================================

This is the result of playing around with libGDX with the aim of making a Pong game.

Run with `gradle run`.

"Features":

- Using a single project gradle build, because this only targets the desktop.
- Using libgdx's freetype extension to scale fonts properly
